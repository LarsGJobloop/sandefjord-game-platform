# Continuous Integration (CI)

## What is CI?

Continuous Integration is about maintaining a continuous feedback loop with your code. Every change triggers automated "scientific inquiries" that test hypotheses about the code's behavior and quality.

## The Continuous Feedback Loop

CI jobs are essentially experiments that ask: "Does this change break anything?" They run automatically and continuously, providing immediate feedback on:

- **Code health** - Does it compile, format correctly, pass tests?
- **Integration safety** - Does it work with the existing codebase?
- **Quality standards** - Does it meet project requirements?

## Scientific Approach

Each CI run is like a scientific experiment:

- **Hypothesis**: "This change should work without breaking anything"
- **Test**: Run automated checks and validations
- **Result**: Pass/fail with specific evidence
- **Action**: Fix issues or proceed based on results

This continuous experimentation catches problems early and builds confidence in every change.

## Assertions and Branch Protection

CI assertions are enforced through branch protection rules. The goal is to create automated gatekeepers that:

- **Block broken changes** - Prevent merging until all assertions pass
- **Require evidence** - Force proof that changes work before acceptance
- **Maintain quality** - Ensure only validated code enters the main branch
- **Enable collaboration** - Let multiple developers work safely without breaking each other's code

In practice, we're still learning and making mistakes. Branch protection helps us catch issues, but it's not perfect - it's a tool to help us improve over time.

## Why Continuous Feedback Matters

- **Immediate validation** - Know instantly if your change works
- **Reduced risk** - Problems are caught before they compound
- **Faster development** - No waiting for manual testing cycles
- **Confidence** - Each change is validated against the whole system

CI transforms development from "hope and pray" to "test and verify."
