# Delivery Standardization

## What is Delivery Standardization?

Delivery standardization transforms software deployment from custom, environment-specific procedures into uniform, predictable delivery vehicles. It establishes consistent runtime boundaries and clear interfaces that work identically across any environment that supports the delivery mechanism.

## The Standardization Approach

Standardized delivery packages applications with their complete runtime environment:

- **Self-contained** - Everything needed to run the application is included
- **Consistent interface** - Same package runs identically on any supported platform
- **Predictable behavior** - Eliminates environment-specific variations
- **Portable deployment** - Move packages between environments without modification

## Clear Runtime Boundaries

Standardized delivery establishes well-defined boundaries between applications and their environment:

- **Resource isolation** - Applications can't interfere with each other or the host system
- **Interface contracts** - Clear definitions of what the package needs and provides
- **Controlled interaction** - Explicit configuration of how packages communicate
- **Security boundaries** - Isolated execution environments with defined access controls

Unlike reproducibility (which focuses on ensuring identical content and behavior), delivery standardization focuses on establishing consistent boundaries and interfaces, regardless of the specific content within those boundaries.

## What Gets Standardized

### Application Runtime Environment

- **Operating system libraries** - Consistent system-level dependencies
- **Runtime environments** - .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, or other language runtimes
- **Application dependencies** - Libraries, frameworks, and packages
- **Configuration** - Environment variables, file paths, and system settings

### Delivery Interface

- **Startup behavior** - How the package initializes and starts the application
- **Health checks** - How the system determines if the application is running correctly
- **Logging interface** - How the application outputs logs and diagnostic information
- **Resource requirements** - CPU, memory, and storage needs

### Boundary Contracts

- **Network interfaces** - How the package communicates with external services
- **Storage interfaces** - How the package accesses persistent data
- **Environment configuration** - What external configuration the package expects
- **Service dependencies** - What other services the package requires to function

## Why Delivery Standardization Matters

- **Predictable deployments** - Standardized packages behave identically across environments
- **Simplified scaling** - Deploy the same package to multiple servers
- **Easier maintenance** - Update packages without environment-specific considerations
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined interfaces between applications and their environment
- **Reduced complexity** - Standardized delivery processes across all applications
- **Facilitates attestation** - Standardized boundaries enable clear verification and signoff processes
- **Enables audit trails** - Consistent interfaces make it easier to track and validate system behavior

## Living Standardization

Delivery standardization is not a one-time setup but an ongoing practice:

- **Interface evolution** - Update boundary contracts as requirements change
- **Performance optimization** - Refine resource requirements and startup behavior
- **Security updates** - Keep standardized packages and runtime environments current

However, while we strive for perfect standardization, we must also recognize its practical limitations.

## The Limits of Delivery Standardization

While delivery standardization is valuable, it has practical limits:

- **Hardware-specific applications** - Some software requires specific hardware or drivers
- **Legacy systems** - Older applications may not standardize easily
- **Platform limitations** - Not all environments support standardized delivery
